PURPOSE
To establish comprehensive data access controls protecting organizational information assets from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure, in compliance with Information Technology Act, 2021 and cybersecurity best practices.

SCOPE
All personnel with access to organizational systems, networks, and data repositories.

ACCESS CONTROL FRAMEWORK

1. USER IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION
1.1 User Account Management:
    - Unique user identifier assigned to each individual
    - Account creation documented with manager authorization
    - Account deactivation completed within 24 hours of termination
    - Contractor accounts clearly marked and monitored

1.2 Authentication Requirements:
    - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) mandatory for sensitive systems
    - Strong password policy enforced (minimum 12 characters, complexity required)
    - Password change required every 90 days
    - No password sharing or sharing of credentials permitted
    - Session timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity

2. ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC)
2.1 Access Role Definition:
    - Roles defined based on job function and need-to-know principle
    - Each role assigned specific system and data access permissions
    - Principle of least privilege strictly enforced
    - Regular access review conducted quarterly

2.2 Access Provisioning Process:
    - Access request submitted through formal ticketing system
    - Manager approval required before provisioning
    - IT Security review completed for sensitive access
    - Provisioning completed and documented within 48 hours
    - User acknowledgment obtained

3. DATA CLASSIFICATION AND PROTECTION
3.1 Data Classification:
    - Public: Unrestricted access
    - Internal: Restricted to authorized employees
    - Confidential: Restricted to specific departments/roles
    - Restricted: Severely limited access, encryption required

3.2 Protection Measures:
    - Confidential and Restricted data encrypted at rest and in transit
    - Access to Restricted data requires additional authentication
    - Data masking applied for personally identifiable information (PII)
    - Audit logs maintained for all access to Confidential/Restricted data

4. PRIVILEGED ACCESS MANAGEMENT (PAM)
4.1 Administrative Access Controls:
    - Administrator accounts separated from standard user accounts
    - Administrative access logged and monitored
    - Privileged session recording enabled for sensitive operations
    - Just-in-time (JIT) access provisioning for temporary needs

4.2 Approval and Monitoring:
    - All privileged access requests require dual approval
    - Privileged activities audited and reviewed regularly
    - Unusual privileged access flagged for investigation
    - Annual recertification of privileged users required

5. NETWORK AND SYSTEM ACCESS
5.1 Network Access Controls:
    - VPN required for remote access
    - IP whitelisting implemented for sensitive systems
    - Network segmentation implemented for critical systems
    - Firewall rules enforced with allow-list approach

5.2 System Access Logging:
    - Login/logout events logged with timestamp and IP address
    - Failed login attempts monitored for unauthorized access attempts
    - Access logs retained minimum 1 year
    - Suspicious access patterns escalated to security team

6. INCIDENT RESPONSE FOR ACCESS VIOLATIONS
6.1 Detection:
    - Automated alerts for suspicious access patterns
    - Regular access anomaly reviews
    - User reporting of suspicious access encouraged

6.2 Response Protocol:
    - Unauthorized access immediately reported to security team
    - Account suspended pending investigation
    - Forensic analysis initiated
    - Incident documented for regulatory reporting
