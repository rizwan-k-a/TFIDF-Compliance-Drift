GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR CLASSIFICATION OF FILMS AND OTHER
ENTERTAINMENT PROGRAMMES, INCLUDING WEB BASED SERIALS
There are general factors that may influence a classification decision at any level and in
connection with any issue and the following factors are elucidated which may be read along
with Part II of the Guidelines -
Curated content may be considered in the light of the period depicted in such content and
the contemporary standards of the country and the people to which such content relates.
Therefore, the context in which an issue is presented within a film or video may be given
consideration. Factors such as the setting of a work (historical, fantasy, realistic,
contemporary etc.), the manner of presentation of the content, the apparent intention of
the content, the original production date of the content, and any special merits of the work
may influence the classification decision.
Classification decisions may take into the theme of any content but will depend
significantly on the treatment of that theme, especially the sensitivity of its presentation.
The most challenging themes (for example, drug misuse, violence, pedophilia, sex, racial
or communal hatred or violence etc.) are unlikely to be appropriate at the junior levels of
Curated content may be judged in its entirety from the point of view of its overall impact.
The tone of content can be an important factor in deciding the influence it may have on
various groups of people. Thus, films/serials that have a stronger depiction of violence
may receive a higher classification.
The classification of any content may also depend upon the target audience of the work
and the impact of the work on such audience.
This part of the guidelines comprises the issues and concerns that apply in varying degrees to
all categories of classification and elaborates the general approach that may be taken in this
regard to the same. These concerns are listed in alphabetical order, and are to be read with the
four General Guidelines listed in Part I —
The categorical classification of content shall take into account the impact of a film on
matters such as caste, race, gender, religion, disability or sexuality that may arise in a
wide range of works, and the classification decision will take account of the strength or
(b) Psychotropic substances, liquor, smoking and tobacco:
Films or serials, etc. that as a whole portray misuse of psychotropic substances, liquor,
smoking and tobacco would qualify for a higher category of classification.
(1) Classification decisions may take into account any portrayal of criminal and violent
(2) Portrayal of potentially dangerous behaviour that are likely to incite the
commission of any offence (including suicide, and infliction of self-harm) and that
children and young people may potentially copy, shall receive a higher
(3) Films or serials with song and dance scenes comprising lyrics and gestures that
have sexual innuendos would receive a higher classification.
(1) Language is of particular importance, given the vast linguistic diversity of our
country. The use of language, dialect, idioms and euphemisms vary from region to
region and are culture-specific. This factor has to be taken into account during the
process of classification of a work in a particular category.
(2) Language that people may find offensive includes the use of expletives. The extent
of offence may vary according to age, gender, race, background, beliefs and
expectations of the target audience from the work as well as the context, region and
language in which the word, expression or gesture is used.
(3) It is not possible to set out a comprehensive list of words, expressions or gestures
that are acceptable at each category in every Indian language. The advice at
different classification levels, therefore, provides general guidance to consider
while judging the level of classification for content, based on this guideline.
(1) No content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be published or
(2) Nudity with a sexual context will receive a higher classification of “A”.
No content that is prohibited by law at the time being in force can be published or
transmitted. The classification of content in various ratings from U/A 16+ to “A” shall
depend upon the portrayal of non-explicit (implicit) to explicit depiction of sexual
Classification decisions shall take account of the degree and nature of violence in a
